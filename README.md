A Cell Biology and Public Health Project 

We conducted surveys for the causes of drugs and the effects of drug use in a four-person team. In our research, we discovered that the age group's lower bound begins at the age of 12 and the upper bound reaches 65. It was shocking to discover such a wide age gap, and the main causes were stress, feeling lonely or excluded, and peer pressure, all of which lead to the well-known harmful effects of drugs. We also went to rehabilitation centres, like Benazir Shaheed ANF MATRC, to learn about drug users' recovery processes and discovered that their families are not ready to accept people who have fought their war against drug use and simply leave them there, which is why we decided to make an awareness video to encourage people to stop using drugs and to show how we can help them fight their war by breaking the stigma in society and accepting and appreciating them for doing so.
